AngularJs Starter (simplified version of NG6)

The de facto starter repo for building scalable apps with Angular, ES6, and Webpack
This repo serves as a minimal starter for those looking to get up-and-running with Angular and ES6, using Webpack for the build process.

Build System

Webpack handles all file-related concerns:

Transpiling from ES6 to ES5 with Babel
Loading HTML files as modules
Transpiling stylesheets and appending them to the DOM
Refreshing the browser and rebuilding on file changes
Hot module replacement for transpiled stylesheets
Bundling the app
Loading all modules
Doing all of the above for *.spec.js files as well
